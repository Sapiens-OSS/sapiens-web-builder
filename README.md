# Sapiens Web Builder 2
SWB 2 is a complete rebuild of the web app, from the ground up. It now supports the concept of 'projects', and a variety of ways to load them. It uses local storage/indexed DB by default, but can be connected to external file servers (coming) and GitHub (coming).

## What is Sapiens Web Builder?
Sapiens Web Builder is a web app that allows anyone to easily create Hammerstone mods through it's DDAPI functionality. It's designed to lower the skill level required to make mods for Sapiens, without compromising too much on control. 

## Usage
The Sapiens Web Builder is hosted, for free, by GitHub on GitHub pages. It's automatically deployed from the `main` branch of this repository.

Alternatively, you can run a development server by install NPM packages (e.g. `yarn`), then running the `dev` script (e.g. `yarn dev`)
