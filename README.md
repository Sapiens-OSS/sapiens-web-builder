# Sapiens Web Builder 2
SWB 2 is a complete rebuild of the web app, from the ground up. It now supports the concept of 'projects', and a variety of ways to load them. It uses local storage/indexed DB by default, but can be connected to external file servers (coming) and GitHub (coming).

## Usage
The Sapiens Web Builder is hosted, for free, by GitHub on GitHub pages. It's automatically deployed from the `main` branch of this repository.

Alternatively, you can run a development server by install NPM packages (e.g. `yarn`), then running the `dev` script (e.g. `yarn dev`)
