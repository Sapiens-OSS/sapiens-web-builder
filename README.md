# Sapiens Web Builder
This is a small web app that generates mod using the DDAPI from Hammerstone. 

## Contributing
It's a default Nuxt project, so you will need some experience with that. Otherwise, there's nothing new. If you want to just look at the website, without developing, try this:
```
npm install
```

then

```
npm run dev
```
